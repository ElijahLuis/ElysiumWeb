🌟 Star Discovery & Collection Mechanics
1. Discovering a Star
Users encounter a Collectible Star while exploring a realm.
Upon interaction, the star splits into three truths (small questions or quotes).
The user must choose one that resonates most with them.
Their choice adds that truth to their Personal Star Collection.

💡 Example Scenario:
A user exploring the Rift Realm (Sadness & Emotional Pain) finds a star.
It splits into three truths:

🌟 "Grief is love persevering."
🌟 "You do not heal by forgetting, but by remembering differently."
🌟 "Even the stars you can’t see are still there."

The user selects the one that resonates most, and it is added to their collection.
~~~
2. The Personal Star Collection

Users collect stars over time, forming a constellation map unique to their emotional journey.

Each collected star retains:
✨ The truth they chose.
📅 The date they discovered it.
🌌 The realm it came from.
💡 Design Note:

The collection could visually resemble a starry night sky, with stars grouped by realm.
Users might zoom in on a star to re-read its truth.
~~~
3. Trading & Constellation Formation

Stars can be traded or gifted between users.
A traded star keeps its entire history of previous owners.
These connected users form a "Constellation"—a symbolic emotional network.

💡 Example Scenario:
A user trades their Haven Star (Hope) to another user in the Abyss Realm (Fear).
Now, the star’s history shows:

🌟 Elijah (original owner) → transferred to Alex → transferred to Maya.
This star’s constellation visually links all three users.
~~~
4. Special & Rare Stars

A. Untradeable "Core Stars"
Some stars are personal growth milestones and cannot be traded.
Example: A star from Ascendia (Confidence) after overcoming self-doubt.

B. Legendary Stars
Rare stars that only appear under certain emotional conditions.
Maybe after an intense moment of self-reflection, a hidden star appears.
Example: A user navigating Paradoxus (Confusion) deeply questions their reality and triggers a rare star with a unique truth about clarity and uncertainty.

C. Companion Stars
Some stars only unlock when traded.
These require another user’s participation—encouraging shared reflection.
Example: A “Bravery” Star from Ember can only be unlocked when gifted to another user.
~~~
5. User Interaction with Constellations
Users can view their constellation—showing stars they collected and those they share with others.
Privacy settings allow users to choose whether their constellation is public or private.
Constellations may have unlockable rewards (visuals, reflections, or insights).

💡 Example:

A user sees three people who share a star about healing from grief.
They now feel less alone, knowing others have walked the same path.
~~~
6. Floating User Thoughts & Their Role
Floating Thoughts appear in each realm, shaped by Insight, Bravery, Resonance, and Momentum.
Popular thoughts in each realm may be transformed into Collectible Stars.
This means users' words could become truths that others collect.

💡 Example:
A user writes: “Fear doesn’t go away, but you can learn to walk with it.”
If it gains high Resonance & Bravery, it becomes a star in the Abyss Realm for others to discover.
