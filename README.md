# Elysium Web

This repository contains the static assets for the Elysium Web project. The `client/` directory holds the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make up the site.

## Running locally

A small Node server is included to serve the contents of `client/` for development. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). No additional dependencies are required.

## Exploring the Universe demo

After logging in you can navigate to the planetary view by clicking **Begin Your Journey**. The page `pages/universe.html` lets you create short posts tied to an emotion. As people react with different emotions, each post will migrate to the planet that best represents the community response.
