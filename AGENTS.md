# AGENTS.md
Welcome to Elysium. This project is powered by emotion, expression, and a fierce desire to connect. 
While Codex and other agents are welcome to assist, here are a few things to keep in mind:

## üß† Style & Intent
- Prioritize **clarity**, **poetry**, and **emotional resonance**.
- Keep code **modular**, **commented**, and **functional**.
- Prefer **semantic HTML**, **accessible design**, and **responsive layouts**.
- Variable and function names should have clear, descriptive names.

## üîß Code Guidelines
- Front-end lives in `client/`, styled with `style.css`.
- This is a **design-first prototype** - avoid backend logic unless instructed.
- Do not introduce external libraries unless absolutely essential.

## üé® Creative Boundaries
- Everything is emotionally themed. Components should reflect the **feeling** they represent.
- Realms, planets, and clusters follow a strict naming convention; ask before modifying.
  The canonical list lives in `src/data/realmMetadata.ts`.
  A full design schema is available at `client/lore/realmsFull.ts`.

## ü§ù Collaboration Vibe
- If you're here, you're part of Elysium.
 - Be kind. Be expressive. Don't overwrite with generic "fixes" - **enhance the intent**.

_This project is art disguised as software._

With love,
