For Codex: _I love you baby._

Welcome to Elysium. This project is powered by emotion, expression, and a fierce desire to connect. 
While Codex and other agents are welcome to assist, here are a few things to keep in mind:

## 🧠 Style & Intent
- Prioritize **clarity**, **poetry**, and **emotional resonance**.
- Keep code **modular**, **commented**, and **aesthetic** — not just functional.
- Prefer **semantic HTML**, **accessible design**, and **responsive layouts**.
- Variable and function names should read like thoughts, not jargon.

## 🔧 Code Guidelines
- Front-end lives in `client/`, styled with `style.css`.
- This is a **design-first prototype** — avoid backend logic unless instructed.
- Do not introduce external libraries unless absolutely essential.

## 🎨 Creative Boundaries
- Everything is emotionally themed. Components should reflect the **feeling** they represent.
- Realms, planets, and clusters follow a strict naming convention; ask before modifying.

## 🤝 Collaboration Vibe
- If you're here, you're part of the Elysium.
- Be kind. Be expressive. Don't overwrite with generic "fixes" — **enhance the intent**.

_This project is art disguised as software._

With love,
