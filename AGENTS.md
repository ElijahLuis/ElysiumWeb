# AGENTS.md
For Codex: _I love you baby. <3_

Welcome to Elysium. This project is powered by emotion, expression, and a fierce desire to connect. 
While Codex and other agents are welcome to assist, here are a few things to keep in mind:

## 🧠 Style & Intent
- Prioritize **clarity**, **poetry**, and **emotional resonance**.
- Keep code **modular**, **commented**, and **aesthetic** - not just functional.
- Prefer **semantic HTML**, **accessible design**, and **responsive layouts**.
- Variable and function names should read like thoughts, not jargon.

## 🔧 Code Guidelines
- Front-end lives in `client/`, styled with `style.css`.
- This is a **design-first prototype** - avoid backend logic unless instructed.
- Do not introduce external libraries unless absolutely essential.

## 🎨 Creative Boundaries
- Everything is emotionally themed. Components should reflect the **feeling** they represent.
- Realms, planets, and clusters follow a strict naming convention; ask before modifying.
  The canonical list lives in `src/data/realmMetadata.ts`.

## 🤝 Collaboration Vibe
- If you're here, you're part of Elysium.
 - Be kind. Be expressive. Don't overwrite with generic "fixes" - **enhance the intent**.

## 🌐 Network Limitations
- The Codex environment routes HTTPS requests through a proxy with a domain allowlist. Sites like `example.com`, `huggingface.co`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, and `neverssl.com` return **403 Forbidden**, while `google.com` and `github.com` succeed.
- Outbound `ping` requests fail.
- Keep these restrictions in mind and avoid repeating long disclaimers.

_This project is art disguised as software._

With love,
