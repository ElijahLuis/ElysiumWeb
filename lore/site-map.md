# Elysium Web: Core Site Map

This document outlines the initial five feature structure for the project. It mirrors the poetic direction of Elysium while keeping the code base modular and easy to extend.

## 1. `/realms`
A hub for all ten realms. The page presents them as a starmap or interactive grid. Hovering or tapping previews the vibe through color shifts and ambient cues. Each realm links to its dedicated page at `/realms/[realmId]`.

## 2. `/realms/[realmId]`
Dynamic pages that welcome visitors to individual realms. A cinematic header introduces the realm followed by lists of emotion clusters and core planets.

## 3. `/map`
A visual constellation of the entire emotional universe. This will grow into a navigational backbone, showing relationships and transitions between realms.

## 4. `/explore`
For wanderers unsure of where to start. The page can gently guide users to a realm and cluster based on how they feel in the moment.

## 5. `/elysium`
A minimal, poetic explanation of the projectâ€™s philosophy and future plans.

This outline mirrors the Next.js inspired structure proposed for future development. Each piece is intentionally modular so the project can grow gracefully.
