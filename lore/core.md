# Elysium: Core Philosophy and Framework

## What Is Elysium?
Elysium is a digital cosmos built to explore, express, and elevate the emotional experience. 
Unlike traditional social media-designed around visibility, performance, and comparison,
Elysium centers its architecture around authentic inner states. 
It is not a feed, but a journey. 
Each post, interaction, and reflection orbits a feeling.

## Why It Exists
Elysium was born from the desire to name the unnamed. In a world where emotional literacy is fragmented, performative, or suppressed, Elysium creates space for honesty without spectacle. It seeks to:

* Normalize difficult emotions
* Encourage personal reflection
* Reward truthfulness, not popularity
* Turn vulnerability into a connective force

## How It Works
Users begin by selecting a core emotion, or allowing the system to guide them based on reflective prompts. 
They are taken to a realm (an emotional dimension) where they can:

* Share posts tethered to that feeling
* Leave or collect "gifts" left by others (artifacts of insight or solidarity)
* Explore a constellation of related emotions

Each post becomes a star in orbit around a planet (core emotion), gradually forming constellations of living archives.

## Key Differences From Social Media
| Feature    | Traditional Social Media | Elysium                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Focus      | Identity, visibility     | Emotion, authenticity        |
| Engagement | Likes, comments, shares  | Gifts, stars, constellations |
| Sorting    | Algorithmic feeds        | Emotion-based clusters       |
| Incentive  | Attention                | Reflection + connection      |

## Design Philosophy

Elysium is:
* **Cinematic**, not sterile. Realms feel like immersive environments.
* **Emotive**, not performative. Expression comes from within, not for an audience.
* **Fluid**, not gamified. Progress is soulful, not point-based.

## The Realm System
Each realm is a distinct emotional world. Every realm contains 2-5 emotion clusters.
Each cluster has a Core Planet, which is an atomized feeling that defines the cluster.

Elysium is composed of ten distinct realms, each a vast emotional dimension shaped by the shared inner landscapes of its travelers. 
These realms serve as immersive reflections of human feeling - fluid, symbolic, and interconnected. The canonical list lives in `src/data/realmMetadata.ts`, where each realm is defined by name. They include:
* **Oasis** - A refuge of belonging and grateful joy. Peaceful meadows share space with playful springs, nurturing contentment and gentle love.
* **Abyss** - Depths etched by fear, helplessness, and rising panic. Numb isolation and hopeless dread echo through the void.
* **Zenith** - The summit of empowerment and pride. Resilience rings like an anvil as liberation brightens the horizon.
* **Languish** - A cold plateau where despair and grief settle. Numb detachment and isolation drift like heavy fog.
* **Cavern** - Twisting tunnels of jealousy and contempt. Idolization curdles into obsession while bitterness festers in the dark.
* **Dross** - A wasteland steeped in revulsion and self-loathing. Violation leaves stains longing to be cleansed.
* **Ember** - Fields of frustration and reckless daring. Rage smolders beside impatience and aggressive sparks.
* **Glare** - A searing stage of shame and judgment. Repressed tension magnifies every flaw.
* **Mist** - A labyrinth of curiosity and doubt. Confusion mingles with surreal wonder along shifting paths.
* **Trace** - Trails of nostalgia and yearning. Regret and wistful daydreams flicker through memory.

## Future Vision

Elysium will become a living dictionary of emotion - a place where users can:
* Name how they feel
* Contribute to emotion constellations
* Build legacy through emotional clarity
* Find others who understand them without needing to explain

This is not an escape from the world. Itâ€™s a return to the self, with stars to guide you.
