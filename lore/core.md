# Elysium: Core Philosophy and Framework

## What Is Elysium?
Elysium is a digital cosmos built to explore, express, and elevate the emotional experience. 
Unlike traditional social media-designed around visibility, performance, and comparison,
Elysium centers its architecture around authentic inner states. 
It is not a feed, but a journey. 
Each post, interaction, and reflection orbits a feeling.

## Why It Exists
Elysium was born from the desire to name the unnamed. In a world where emotional literacy is fragmented, performative, or suppressed, Elysium creates space for honesty without spectacle. It seeks to:

* Normalize difficult emotions
* Encourage personal reflection
* Reward truthfulness, not popularity
* Turn vulnerability into a connective force

## How It Works
Users begin by selecting a core emotion, or allowing the system to guide them based on reflective prompts. 
They are taken to a realm (an emotional dimension) where they can:

* Share posts tethered to that feeling
* Leave or collect "gifts" left by others (artifacts of insight or solidarity)
* Explore a constellation of related emotions

Each post becomes a star in orbit around a planet (core emotion), gradually forming constellations of living archives.

## Key Differences From Social Media
| Feature    | Traditional Social Media | Elysium                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Focus      | Identity, visibility     | Emotion, authenticity        |
| Engagement | Likes, comments, shares  | Gifts, stars, constellations |
| Sorting    | Algorithmic feeds        | Emotion-based clusters       |
| Incentive  | Attention                | Reflection + connection      |

## Design Philosophy

Elysium is:
* **Cinematic**, not sterile. Realms feel like immersive environments.
* **Emotive**, not performative. Expression comes from within, not for an audience.
* **Fluid**, not gamified. Progress is soulful, not point-based.

## The Realm System
Each realm is a distinct emotional world. Every realm contains 2-5 emotion clusters.
Each cluster has a Core Planet, which is an atomized feeling that defines the cluster.

Elysium is composed of ten distinct realms, each a vast emotional dimension shaped by the shared inner landscapes of its travelers. 
These realms serve as immersive reflections of human feeling — fluid, symbolic, and interconnected. The canonical list lives in `src/data/realmMetadata.ts`, where each realm is defined by name. They include:
* **Oasis** - A tranquil refuge radiating warmth, affection, and serenity. Here, joy is rooted in presence; love flows gently, and peace moves like a soft current beneath the soul.
* **Abyss** - A desolate, shadowed plane carved by fear, helplessness, and rising panic. Feelings unravel into echoing voids, yet even darkness holds structure and meaning.
* **Zenith** - The soaring peak of self-possession and purposeful pride. Its landscapes pulse with clarity, moral conviction, and the brilliance of inner alignment.
* **Languish** - A still, weighted expanse where vitality dulls and desire feels distant. Languish isn't despair, but the slow erosion of spark - a coldness draping over willpower.
* **Cavern** - A hushed terrain of introspection. Echoing chambers invite confrontation with hidden wounds, while glints of resilience linger in the stone.
* **Dross** - An industrial wasteland forged from disappointment and decay. Here, impurities surface so that transformation may begin.
* **Ember** - A realm of smoldering resolve where anger fuels courage. Sparks of passion ignite momentum toward change.
* **Glare** - A horizon ablaze with jealousy, judgment, and harsh truths. In its light, growth emerges through the burn of honesty.
* **Mist** - A fog-laden territory of uncertainty and memory. Boundaries blur, and quiet reflection drifts like vapor across the landscape.
* **Trace** - A borderland of nostalgia and lingering attachments. Past moments flicker like afterimages, urging travelers to acknowledge what remains unfinished.

## Future Vision

Elysium will become a living dictionary of emotion - a place where users can:
* Name how they feel
* Contribute to emotion constellations
* Build legacy through emotional clarity
* Find others who understand them without needing to explain

This is not an escape from the world. It’s a return to the self, with stars to guide you.
