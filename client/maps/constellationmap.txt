âœ¨ Discovering a Star:

When a user finds a Collectible Star, it splits into three truths.
They must choose the one that resonates mostâ€”this truth is added to their Personal Star Collection.

ðŸŒ  Trading & Constellations:

Stars can be gifted or traded between users.
Each star keeps a record of its previous owners, forming a Constellation:
a visual and symbolic representation of connections between people who have felt similar emotions.

ðŸ”— Deepening the Social Aspect:

Some stars might be untradeable (personal growth stars).
Users might seek out others with matching stars to expand their constellation.
Rare stars could existâ€”maybe stars that only appear in special circumstances, or those that require specific emotional journeys to unlock.
