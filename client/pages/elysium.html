          <h2 class="stellar-heading">What Is Elysium?</h2>
          <p>
            Elysium is a digital cosmos built to explore, express, and elevate
            the emotional experience. Unlike traditional social media—designed
            around visibility, performance, and comparison—Elysium centers its
            architecture around authentic inner states. It is not a feed, but a
            journey. Each post, interaction, and reflection orbits a feeling.
          </p>

        <section id="why-it-exists">
          <h2 class="stellar-heading">Why It Exists</h2>
          <p>
            Elysium was born from the desire to name the unnamed. In a world
            where emotional literacy is fragmented, performative, or suppressed,
            Elysium creates space for honesty without spectacle. It seeks to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normalize difficult emotions</li>
            <li>Encourage personal reflection</li>
            <li>Reward truthfulness, not popularity</li>
            <li>Turn vulnerability into a connective force</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="how-it-works">
          <h2 class="stellar-heading">How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Users begin by selecting a core emotion, or allowing the system to
            guide them based on reflective prompts. They are taken to a realm
            (an emotional dimension) where they can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Share posts tethered to that feeling</li>
            <li>
              Leave or collect “gifts” left by others (artifacts of insight or
              solidarity)
            </li>
            <li>Explore a constellation of related emotions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each post becomes a star in orbit around a planet (core emotion),
            gradually forming constellations of living archives.

          <p>Elysium is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cinematic</strong>, not sterile. Realms feel like
              immersive environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emotive</strong>, not performative. Expression comes from
              within, not for an audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fluid</strong>, not gamified. Progress is soulful, not
              point-based.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="realm-system">
          <h2 class="stellar-heading">The Realm System</h2>
          <p>
            Each realm is a distinct emotional world containing 2–5 emotion
            clusters. Each cluster has a Core Planet, an atomized feeling that
            defines the cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elysium is composed of ten realms reflected in
            <code>src/data/realmMetadata.ts</code>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Oasis</strong> – A refuge of belonging and grateful joy.
              Peaceful meadows share space with playful springs, nurturing
              contentment and gentle love.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Abyss</strong> – Depths etched by fear, helplessness, and
              rising panic. Numb isolation and hopeless dread echo through the
              void.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zenith</strong> – The summit of empowerment and pride.
              Resilience rings like an anvil as liberation brightens the
              horizon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Languish</strong> – A cold plateau where despair and grief
              settle. Numb detachment and isolation drift like heavy fog.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cavern</strong> – Twisting tunnels of jealousy and
              contempt. Idolization curdles into obsession while bitterness
              festers in the dark.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dross</strong> – A wasteland steeped in revulsion and
              self-loathing. Violation leaves stains longing to be cleansed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ember</strong> – Fields of frustration and reckless
              daring. Rage smolders beside impatience and aggressive sparks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Glare</strong> – A searing stage of shame and judgment.
              Repressed tension magnifies every flaw.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mist</strong> – A labyrinth of curiosity and doubt.
              Confusion mingles with surreal wonder along shifting paths.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trace</strong> – Trails of nostalgia and yearning. Regret
              and wistful daydreams flicker through memory.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="stellar-heading">Future Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Elysium will become a living dictionary of emotion—a place where
            users can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name how they feel</li>
            <li>Contribute to emotion constellations</li>
            <li>Build legacy through emotional clarity</li>
            <li>Find others who understand them without needing to explain</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not an escape from the world. It’s a return to the self,
            with stars to guide you.
          </p>
