          </h2>
          <p>
            Elysium is a digital cosmos built to explore, express, and elevate
            the emotional experience. Unlike traditional social media—designed
            around visibility, performance, and comparison—Elysium centers its
            architecture around authentic inner states. It is not a feed, but a
            journey. Each post, interaction, and reflection orbits a feeling.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Elysium was born from the desire to name the unnamed. In a world
            where emotional literacy is fragmented, performative, or suppressed,
            Elysium creates space for honesty without spectacle. It seeks to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normalize difficult emotions</li>
            <li>Encourage personal reflection</li>
            <li>Reward truthfulness, not popularity</li>
            <li>Turn vulnerability into a connective force</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="stellar-heading">
            <span class="header-icon">🔧</span>How It Works
          </h2>
          <p>
            Users begin by selecting a core emotion, or allowing the system to
            guide them based on reflective prompts. They are taken to a realm
            (an emotional dimension) where they can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Share posts tethered to that feeling</li>
            <li>
              Leave or collect “gifts” left by others (artifacts of insight or
              solidarity)
            </li>
            <li>Explore a constellation of related emotions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each post becomes a star in orbit around a planet (core emotion),
            gradually forming constellations of living archives.

          <p>Elysium is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cinematic</strong>, not sterile. Realms feel like
              immersive environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emotive</strong>, not performative. Expression comes from
              within, not for an audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fluid</strong>, not gamified. Progress is soulful, not
              point-based.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="stellar-heading">
            <span class="header-icon">🪐</span>The Realm System
          </h2>
          <p>
            Each realm is a distinct emotional world containing 2–5 emotion
            clusters. Each cluster has a Core Planet, an atomized feeling that
            defines the cluster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elysium is composed of ten realms reflected in
            <code>src/data/realmMetadata.ts</code>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-oasis">🌴 Oasis</span>
              – A refuge of belonging and grateful joy. Peaceful meadows share
              space with playful springs, nurturing contentment and gentle love.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-abyss">🕳️ Abyss</span>
              – Depths etched by fear, helplessness, and rising panic. Numb
              isolation and hopeless dread echo through the void.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-zenith">🚀 Zenith</span>
              – The summit of empowerment and pride. Resilience rings like an
              anvil as liberation brightens the horizon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-languish">💧 Languish</span>
              – A cold plateau where despair and grief settle. Numb detachment
              and isolation drift like heavy fog.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-cavern">🪨 Cavern</span>
              – Twisting tunnels of jealousy and contempt. Idolization curdles
              into obsession while bitterness festers in the dark.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-dross">☣️ Dross</span>
              – A wasteland steeped in revulsion and self-loathing. Violation
              leaves stains longing to be cleansed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-ember">🔥 Ember</span>
              – Fields of frustration and reckless daring. Rage smolders beside
              impatience and aggressive sparks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-glare">👁️ Glare</span>
              – A searing stage of shame and judgment. Repressed tension
              magnifies every flaw.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-mist">🌫️ Mist</span>
              – A labyrinth of curiosity and doubt. Confusion mingles with
              surreal wonder along shifting paths.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="realm-name realm-trace">🌀 Trace</span>
              – Trails of nostalgia and yearning. Regret and wistful daydreams
              flicker through memory.

          <p>
            Elysium will become a living dictionary of emotion—a place where
            users can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name how they feel</li>
            <li>Contribute to emotion constellations</li>
            <li>Build legacy through emotional clarity</li>
            <li>Find others who understand them without needing to explain</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not an escape from the world. It’s a return to the self,
            with stars to guide you.
          </p>
